# JoyMix-modpack
The third modpack, this one doesn't have a central objective, but an interest in giving the user as many things to choose to do and enjoy.

At least 3-3.5GiB of RAM is required to play the modpack, ~4GiB is the minimum recomended and ~5GiB should be enough to never run out of RAM in regular scenarios.

OptiFine HD U G7 is recommended and supported.
