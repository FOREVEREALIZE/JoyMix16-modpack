# JoyMix-modpack
The third modpack, this one doesn't have a central objective, but an interest in giving the user as many things to choose to do and enjoy.

At least 4GiB of RAM is required to play the modpack, ~5GiB is the minimum recomended and ~6GiB should be enough to never run out of RAM in regular scenarios.
