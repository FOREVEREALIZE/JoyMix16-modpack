# JoyMix-modpack
The third modpack, this one doesn't have a central objective, but an interest in giving the user as many things to choose to do and enjoy.

At least 3GiB of RAM is required to play the modpack, 3.5GiB is the minimum recomended and 5GiB should be enough to never run out of RAM in regular scenarios.
